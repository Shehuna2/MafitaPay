# This script would create a notification sound using ffmpeg
# Since we don't have ffmpeg in this environment, users need to:
# 1. Create or download a notification.mp3 file
# 2. Place it in this directory: frontend/public/assets/sounds/notification.mp3
# 
# Example sources:
# - Use a free notification sound from https://notificationsounds.com/
# - Create one using online tools like https://www.zapsplat.com/
# - Or use any short (1-2 second) MP3 file

echo "Please add a notification.mp3 file to this directory"
echo "The audio notification system will use this file for alerts"
